Cloning a Repository:

git clone <repository_url>: Creates a local copy of a remote Git repository on your machine.
Basic Workflow:

git status: Shows the status of your local repository, including tracked/untracked files and changes.
git add <file>: Stages changes in a file to be included in the next commit.
git commit -m "commit message": Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
git push: Pushes committed changes to a remote repository.
Branching and Merging:

git branch: Lists all local branches, with the current branch highlighted.
git branch <branch_name>: Creates a new branch.
git checkout <branch_name>: Switches to a different branch.
git merge <branch_name>: Merges changes from another branch into the current branch.
git branch -d <branch_name>: Deletes a branch locally (use -D to force delete).
Remote Repository Interaction:

git remote -v: Lists the remote repositories associated with your local repository.
git fetch: Retrieves changes from a remote repository but doesn't merge them.
git pull origin <branch_name>: Fetches and merges changes from a specific remote branch.
git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes changes to a specific remote branch.
History and Logs:

git log: Displays a log of commits, including commit hashes, authors, dates, and messages.
git log --oneline: Displays a concise log with each commit on one line.
git diff: Shows the differences between the working directory and the last commit.
git show <commit_hash>: Displays details of a specific commit.

Undoing Changes:

git reset <file>: Unstages changes in a file.
git reset <commit_hash>: Moves the branch pointer to a specific commit (use with caution).
git revert <commit_hash>: Creates a new commit that undoes changes introduced by a specific commit.

Stashing Changes:

git stash: Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed.
git stash apply: Applies the most recent stash to the working directory.
git stash list: Lists all stashes.
